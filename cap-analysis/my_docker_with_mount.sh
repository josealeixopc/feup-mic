# This will run the dip-q image, while mounting the /my_results folder on the host's /tmp/results, meaning that any change to that folder
# will be reflected on the host's /tmp/results folder as well.

# The source of the mount is the path to the file or directory on the Docker daemon host.
# The target takes as its value the path where the file or directory is mounted in the container.
